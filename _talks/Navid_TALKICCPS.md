This is a presentation on our latest research paper titled "A Neurosymbolic Approach to the Verification of Temporal Logic Properties of Learning-enabled Control Systems." This work addresses a significant and largely unexplored problem in the realm of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS): the verification of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) properties with a specific attention to neural network-controlled CPS.
