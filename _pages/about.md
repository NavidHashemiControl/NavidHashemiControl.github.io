![Neurosymbolic AI introduction](/images/Neurosymbolic AI.jpg){: .align-right width="300px"}

I have a PhD degree in Computer Science from the school of Engineering in the Univervisty of Southern California (USC-Viterbi) and a M.Sc degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Texas at Dallas, with a focus on Autonomous systems and Control theory.

My focus area is Control systems and Autonomy, Over the course of my M.Sc degree, I was working on the Safety analysis of Networked control system against sensor noise and anomalies and also control synthesis to satisfy safety properties. During my Ph.D degree I also integrated Signal Temporal Logics and Machine Learning (a combination that is called Neurosymbolic AI) in my study and provided scaling and novel techniques for safety verification of autonomous systems with respect to temporal tasks and also learning based control synthesis for an autonomous agents to satisfy temporal specifications.   


# Selected Experience

## Open Source Contribution
I generated the first deterministic formal verification framework for temporal specifications in collaboration with research scientists of Toyota Research Institute North of America (TRINA) [STLVerNN](https://github.com/Navidhashemicodes/STLVerNN) that verifies general Temporal specifications for Learning enabled autonomous control systems.

I noticeably scaled the process of Neural Feedback control learning for agents to satisfy real-world scaled temporal specification [STL_dropout](https://github.com/Navidhashemicodes/STL_dropout). This was achieved by combination of stochastic depth (firstly proposed for ResNet) via Neurosymbolic control synthesis, and have a noticeable contribution in autonomy.

## Research Outcomes
I have published 4 jouranal papers and 17 conference papers focusing on Neurosymbolic Learning and Verification, Autonomous Cyber Physical Systsems and Control Theory in reputable IEEE and ACM journals and conferences.
