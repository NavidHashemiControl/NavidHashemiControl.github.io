Reachability analysis is a popular method to give safety guarantees for stochastic cyber-physical systems (SCPSs) that takes in a symbolic description of the system dynamics and uses set-propagation methods to compute an overapproximation of the set of reachable states over a bounded time horizon. In this article, we investigate the problem of performing reachability analysis for an SCPS that does not have a symbolic description of the dynamics, but instead is described using a digital twin model that can be simulated to generate system trajectories. An important challenge is that the simulator implicitly models a probability distribution over the set of trajectories of the SCPS; however, it is typical to have a sim2real gap, i.e., the actual distribution of the trajectories in a deployment setting may be shifted from the distribution assumed by the simulator. We thus propose a statistical reachability analysis technique that, given a user-provided threshold 1 - ε , provides a set that guarantees that any trajectory during deployment lies in this set with probability not smaller than this threshold. Our method is based on three main steps: 1) learning a deterministic surrogate model from sampled trajectories; 2) conducting reachability analysis over the surrogate model; and 3) employing robust conformal inference (CI) using an additional set of sampled trajectories to quantify the surrogate model’s distribution shift with respect to the deployed SCPS. To counter conservatism in reachable sets, we propose a novel method to train surrogate models that minimizes a quantile loss term (instead of the usual mean squared loss), and a new method that provides tighter guarantees using CI using a normalized surrogate error. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on various case studies.
